## Known Bugs

- Since Aces count as only 11 points instead of player's choice(11 points or 1 point), getting two aces at the start of the game counts as a bust and players lose that round.
- Player's balance can go below zero. I choose not to fix this and leave it as is since the nature of gambling is "high risk, high reward.".
